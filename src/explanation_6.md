# Problem 6: Union and Intersection
## Time complexity
Since this problem is about set theory operations, it is appropriate to use the set data structure.
We need to traverse both lists to create the corresponding sets, which would be O(n).
Union operation takes linear time as well, but intersection has a worst-case complexity of O(n^2).
## Space complexity
Space complexity is linear O(n), since we need to create a set for each of the input lists.
